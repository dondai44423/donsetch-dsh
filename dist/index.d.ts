/**
 * @dsh-external/donsetch : first-class DonSeTch web access for
 * DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * The plugin spawns ONE supervised `donsetch mcp` daemon, registers
 * every tool the daemon lists (tool parity with the standard
 * donsetch MCP server is guaranteed by construction), and proxies
 * calls with the same JSON-RPC discipline as the pi extension: real
 * cancellation, per-call timeouts, clean restart on daemon loss.
 *
 * Native-feel pieces:
 * - tools are registered in-process on ctx.tools with clean names
 *   (donsetch_web_fetch, not mcp__donsetch__web_fetch) and flow
 *   through dsh's full permission/timeout/cancellation pipeline;
 * - each tool carries call/result cards for the Web workbench;
 * - the donsetch config file (the one `donsetch keys add` writes) is
 *   watched, so CLI changes from any terminal reach the live daemon;
 * - a donsetch_status tool reports version, daemon state, and the
 *   doctor output so the agent can self-diagnose;
 * - the binary auto-updates from GitHub Releases on the configured
 *   channel, SHA256-verified, swapped only between in-flight calls;
 * - the harness's native web_search tool is routed through a donsetch
 *   search provider (the bundle patch selects it), so ordinary
 *   web_search calls work with no DeepSeek API key.
 *
 * Zero runtime imports from the host train: the plugin talks to the
 * harness exclusively through the ctx handed to apply().
